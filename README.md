# HueOfHope

Our game is an engaging turn-based deck-builder featuring a unique and compelling art style inspired by the enchanting world of Hollow Knight and Slay The Spire. In this immersive experience, players must strategically combat a variety of enemies using a diverse array of cards. These cards come in different types, including Single-/AOE-Damage, Defense, and Magic. 

# Gameplay

At the start of each battle, your deck is shuffled, ensuring that every encounter feels fresh and challenging. Victory in battle offers the choice of one of three rewards: receiving a new card, removing an unwanted card, or healing yourself for future encounters. As you progress through the game, you will face a series of increasingly difficult enemies, with a boss fight at the end of each chapter. Defeating a boss not only allows you to advance further in the game but also frees an NPC. These NPCs are integral to the unfolding narrative, offering insights into the story and providing crucial assistance in your journey.
